					<h1>Janajati Kalyan Ashram,  Nepal</h1>  
					 
					 <p style="text-align: center;"> Respected well-wishers and helping-hands, </p> 
					<p style="text-align: center;"><br/> We wish for your good health,  prosperity and longevity. <br/> <br/></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; ">Janajati Kalyan Ashram,  Nepal,  since 2061 ,  has been running 
						its service oriented projects in different districts
						of the country for overall development of the Janajati (tribal) communities.
						Since the Janajatis have been dwelling in village and rural areas, 
						who are economically backward,  they have been deprived from the mainstream 
						of development and their proper development has not been possible. 
						For this reason,  anti-nationalist powers have been misusing them.  
						As a result,  the severe problems like conversion,  social animosity, 
					 communal conflict,  and the like have been emerging.</p> 

					<p><br/> Kalyan Ashram,  through different service oriented projects,  
					has been working to strengthen Janajati’s education,  health and self-reliance.  
					Assimilating the main motto,  “Let’s light the candle,  where there is still darkness! ”,
					Kalyan Ashram has been running 11 hostels (including 1 girl’s hostel and 3 hostels
					for earthquake affected children),  15 Khelkud Kendra (Games and Sports Centres), 
				 18 Swayam-Sahayata Samuha (Self-Help Groups),  85 Ekal Vidhyalaya (One Teacher,  One School Program),  \
				 121 Shraddha Jagaran Kendra (Centers run to arouse respect towards indigenous belief system). <br/> <br/> </p>
				 
				<p> Thus,  we humbly request you to help in this pious work,  with the feeling of ‘sewa’ as ‘dharma’ in cash and kind as far as
					 possible and as per the need of the society. </p>
        <h1> Khelkud Kendra</h1> 
				
					<p>Khelkud Kendras have been under operation in different districts to awake the Janajati youths towards games
					  and sports in the society.  Approximately 40%  Janajati communities (except those of municipalities) of the 
						country are backward.  If they are given opportunities,  Janajati art-culture and talents can be recognized 
						in national and international levels.  They can be connected to the mainstream of the country also through 
						games and sports,  and every village can be awakened.</p> 

						<h1>Shraddha Jagaran </h1>

						<p> Through the medium of Satsang,  awakening sentiments,  it has been inevitable to strengthen self-esteem about
						  cultural practices,  own main religion and identity among the Janajatis.  To achieve this objective, 
							 Satsang Centers are under operation in different parts of the country.  
							 As a result of the operation of Shraddha Jagaran Kendra,  it has been difficult for those who,  with their ugly ideology, 
							  have been trying to destroy the local indigenous religion and culture of Nepal.  Thus,  it is very necessary to give continuity
								 to the projects like Shraddha Jagaran and Lok-Kala Mandal (Folk art and culture center) in every village for the upliftment of 
								 one’s own religion.  Through Kalyan Ashram,  such centers are under operation in 121 places of Jhapa,  Morang and Sunsari districts.  
								 </p>
								 <h1>Education</h1>
								 <p>With the motive to encourage the Janajatis of distanced rural areas,  Kalyan Ashram has been running 
									Informal Education (Ekal Vidhyalaya).  Without educated society,  even the development of country cannot be imagined.  
									The concept of development of the entire nation is incomplete without the development of Janajatis.  From the very long past,
									there have been very great contributions by the Janajati communities for the protection of the country and for the protection 
							 of national pride.  There has been the majority of Janajatis in security forces like British Army,  Gorkha Regiment,  and the like. 
								There has been majority of Janajatis even in Nepalese security forces,  but most of the Janajati communities have been deprived of mainstream of education. 
								Because of lack of education and their innocent nature,  there have been rampant conversion activities among the Dalits and the 
						 Janajatis as they become the prey of different temptations.  Since change of religion is change of nationality,  
						 it’s very necessary to connect Janajati sector with the mainstream of education.  There is equal role of village dwellers and 
						 city dwellers for the development of the country.  Kalyan Ashram has been running its informal schools among Santhal,  Tajpuriya,  Rajbanshi,  Tamang, 
						 Chepang and Tharu communities.  It’s necessary to increase the present number of projects in education sector,  for which more means and resources are required. </p>

				     <h1>Hostel</h1>
						  <p>Sincere and capable Janajati students of rural areas are bound to discontinue their study,  because of very low economic status.
								Some children having single parent are bound to work from their early childhood in order to support their family.  With the motive that no child has to 
							 discontinue their education because of economic and family problem,  Kalyan Ashram through ‘Aama Ko Maya Chhatrawas’,  has been managing education,  shelter,  
						 food,  and others for such Janajati children.  At present,  11 such hostels are under operation.  Through this project,  Kalyan Ashram aims to make such children 
						 dedicated towards the society,  ‘Swadharma’ (One’s own religion) and culture,  having good character,   patriotic and competent  citizen as a good person.</p>
						 <h1>Swayam Sahayata Samuha</h1>
					    <p>From development perspective,  rural community is found to be backward in all the aspects.  Women are even limited only upto the domestic activities. 
								Despite enough mutual understanding,  feeling of cooperation,  and the like,  they are unable to support each other significantly in case of need because 
								of their limited access to means and resources.
							Kalyan Ashram works,  in Janajati areas,  by forming Self-Help Groups of women with the motive that they can help each other in case of need.  
							Those women involved in the Groups 
							collect certain amount of money in monthly basis,  and raise a fund so that it can be utilized by the members in case of need.  Swayam Sahayata Samuha works to make the women of
							Janajati society self-reliant.  A part from this,  Swayam Sahayata Samuha has been playing a vital role in encouraging the women for getting involved in skill oriented activities for the
							 generation of income and in minimizing the violence against women.  At present,  Swayam Sahayata Samuhas are under operation in 18 places in the districts like Jhapa,  Okhaldhunga and Chitwan.</p>
